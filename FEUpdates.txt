4.0.0
4.0.0 __**"Small Server" versions only**__
4.0.0 **Save data structure changed** Performing `FE!reboot` from versions below 3.4.0 will update you to 3.4.0, which will create a conversion file, and you will need to perform the command again to fully update.
4.0.0 User information is now stored based on User ID Number.  Users changing their usernames while in a server with these bots will no longer mess up the bot's interpretation of them.
4.0.0 Bots can now join multiple servers.  User information and character references are now stored within a larger array dependent on the first server the bot joined.  Other servers get similar arrays created as the bot joins them.
4.0.0 Commands that were prohibited in PMs due to possibly touching user avatar characters, can now be used just fine in PMs.  Any words that reference an avatar character will, in PM, show the character with default stats.
4.0.0 Users who have trouble seeing embeds can now use the `FE!embeds` command to toggle the bot showing them the results of their commands as plain text.  Setting carries over into PMs.
4.0.0 __**Both "Small Server" and "Large Server" versions**__
4.0.0 The results of the `data` command, when invoking an avatar (either directly or via their kid) will now show the avatar's boon and bane, just like the `unit` command does.
4.0.0 The Homosexuality and Incest filters are now per-server rather than per-bot.  They can be toggled using the `FE!homosexuality` and `FE!incest` commands, respectively.
3.4.0 __**Not sorted**__
3.4.0 **Next update will change the save data structure.**  Update to this version to create a conversion file.
